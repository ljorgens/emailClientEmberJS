Personal assessment week 9

READ ME! Hello fellow developer!

This read me will give you a better understanding of my emailClient project and my website.

Setup

This Setup will only be for MACs because I dont know how to do it for Windows, Sorry PC users!

Specs: I am using Mac OSX yosemite 10.10.1 and the text editor Sublime text 2 along with the

terminal using jquery-1.11.1.js and localstorage and google chrome web browser.  Check my libs folder for all other files.

Create a folder called email_client and copy the folders and names of the files in my repository into it.

You now should have a email_client folder with six folders and 4 files (not including the README).

Make sure lib has 7 files (the ember-data-1.10.0.debug.js is not required), controllers has 3, 

models has 1, routes has 2, templates has 5 and styles has 1 with all the right endings.

To begin you will need to open a python server in the terminal. Now go to localhost:8000 and you should see my app there.

You are ready to go! You should now be able to send your self emails and click on them for more information about them!
